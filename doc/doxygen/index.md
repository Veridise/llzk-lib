# Overview {#mainpage}

LLZK is an open-source Intermediate Representation (IR) for Zero Knowledge (ZK)
circuit languages.
The LLZK project provides a flexible framework, inspired by LLVM, designed to
unify diverse ZK front-end languages and backend ZK architectures.
From an implementation perspective, the LLZK IR is a composition of multiple
[MLIR *dialects*][mlir-dialects] that represent different features that may be present
in the source ZK language.

You can read more about the motivation and design of the project [on our blog][llzk-post].
You can also view [our Ethereum Foundation grant proposal][proposal] that helped fund this project.
